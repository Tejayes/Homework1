# Topics I would like to explore

- IRT project with Monte Carlo
-- I want to learn more about using statistical software to run Monte Carlo studies. I have some research ideas involving standardized testing, and I believe that simulating data will provide a good start to the research.

- DIF Analysis
<<<<<<< HEAD
- I'm also interested in DIF analyses, and I believe that once I learn how to use SAS/R to run such analyses, my research will become more accessible.
