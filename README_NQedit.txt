# Topics I would like to explore

- IRT project with Monte Carlo
-- I want to learn more about using statistical software to run Monte Carlo studies. I have some research ideas involving standardized testing, and I believe that simulating data will provide a good start to the research.

*** What sorts of standardized test results to do you want to analyze, and with what type of groups will you be comparing (age, grade, subject, etc)?***

- DIF Analysis
<<<<<<< HEAD
- I'm also interested in DIF analyses, and I believe that once I learn how to use SAS/R to run such analyses, my research will become more accessible.

*** What is DIF analysis? ***
